 * https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/541/week-3-june-15th-june-21st/3364/
 * Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
 * write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 *
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at
 * least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
 *              received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
 *              Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
 *              two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
 * Note:
 *
 * If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
 *
 * Follow up:
 *
 * This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
 * Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
 *    Hide Hint #1
 * Expected runtime complexity is in O(log n) and the input is sorted.
